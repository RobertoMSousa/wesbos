Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) for a list of everyone's /uses pages!

Everyday I get a few emails asking about the specifics of some piece of software or hardware I use.

I change up things fairly often, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

If there is something missing leave a comment below or ask in my [AMA](https://github.com/wesbos/ama) â€” happy to chat and help you figure out your own situation.

### Editor + Terminal

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor which I switched to in September 2017 after years of Sublime Text.
* [Sublime Text](http://SublimeText.com/3dev) V3 beta is used in most of my video tutorials â€” I write more about my setup in [my book](http://SublimeTextBook.com).
* I created a theme called Cobalt2 for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2), [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2) and [iTerm2](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm) v3 which I use.
* I'm currently using [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) for a font. Yes I paid the $200 for it. Before that I used [Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) for many years.
* I use Operator Mono in VS Code and Hyper Term
* I'm currently switching between Firefox Developer and Chrome Canary as my main browser
* The cursive font you see is just the italic weight of Operator Mono. Your theme must have italics in it for it to work - my Cobalt2 uses italics heavily.
* I currently use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) for my terminal, but many of my videos show me using iTerm2.
* For Sublime Text, The JavaScript suggestions you see in my videos is called [JavaScript Completions](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScript%20Completions) - you might have to play with the settings to get it to not popup some of the node completions. For VS Code, there are no plugins needed to get this.
* You can see most of my config files (.eslint, VS Code settings) over at my [Dot Files repo](https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles) but please don't just take these settings carte blanche - they work for me but might not be the best

### Desktop Apps

* I use [Text Expander](https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander) for canned responses and for most of my code snippets
* I'm a huge [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) fan and have many [workflows](http://wes.io/fY7q).
* I use [Things App](https://culturedcode.com/things/) with a [GTD mindset](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) for managing my tasks.
* I design almost entirely in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
* I backup with 2 time machines local HDDs, [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) for most files, and [BackBlaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/008x60) for my entire hard drive.
* The cool Emoji picker you see me use in my videos is [Rocket](http://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/)

### Recording

* I use [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) to record and edit my screencasts
* I wrote about my [animated gif workflow here](http://wesbos.com/animated-gif-workflow/)
* My mic is a [Heil PR40](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SOYOTQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SOYOTQ&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=YH6ZR6GSGBI2JOJF) on a [PL2T boom arm](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SZVZ74/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SZVZ74&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=HJ6K3KRLOL5XJJSC). Many of my videos were recorded on the cheaper but still amazing [AT2020](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006H92QK&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=PHY64E6Y43GHI55T)
* I use a [DBX286s](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWH79A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LWH79A&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=E3KFCLCQIXXLC7W4) to do almost all my audio compression and processing as a I record and pipe it into my computer with a [Focusrite 2i2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OZE9SA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005OZE9SA&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=ELZASVHMTR6ZTNYL)
* My webcam is a [Logitech HD Pro c920](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JH8T3S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=webo080-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B006JH8T3S&linkId=65a64ee5dd16f2fa18faf2f2d33d0538)
* All this gear is pretty demanding, so I use an ~~[Anker 7/3 port USB 3.0 hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VDVCQ84/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00VDVCQ84&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=d8d1e7a3e461ab7921373dbc07dfbe38)~~ DIED ðŸ˜µ [Amazon Basics 10 Port USB Hub](http://amzn.to/2kVaDCz) to make it all work at once while only having to plug in a single cable.

### Desk Setup

* My main monitor is a 32" 4k [LG 32ud59](https://amzn.to/2SYuX8G)
* To my right I run a vertical 27" 4k [Dell 4k P2715Q](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PC9HFO8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00PC9HFO8&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=5VCVP6ZUPF5GLCUJ) and an open loaded macbook pro nested on a [Rain mStand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000OOYECC&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=XWDACWNC2JWRF3DQ)
* I sit on a [polished aluminum Herman Miller aeron](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LTAO8S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000LTAO8S&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=6G4M6ZR4CYKT3TM5)
* I swapped out the wheels for [ROLLER BLADE WHEELS](https://amzn.to/35zIwUF). Best upgrade ever, highly recommend these. If you have an ikea chair, get the 10mm ones, otherwise 11mm. * My desk is an [8 foot oak butcher block countertop](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/karlby-countertop-oak-veneer-70335207/) on legs
* Here is a [photo of my setup](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1060643936140738560) 
* Everything â€” Monitors, Ethernet, Hard Drives, Webcam, and Power â€” is plugged in via a single USB cable and piped into my [Caldigit TS3 Plus](https://amzn.to/2D9Jnx0) - This is a pretty sweet setup!
* I currently use a 2019 16" MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 32gb memory * My last laptop was a 2017 15" MacBook Pro 3.1GHz i7 with 16gb memory
* The keyboard is an Apple keyboard with a number pad. It's space grey so lots of people think it's some wicked hacker keyboard. I've tried a few mechanical keyboards but they are all too loud for my recording :)
* Mouse is a Logitech MX2 Master

### Other Gear

* After a lengthy search for the perfect backpack for both traveling and schlepping gear around the city I bought the [Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L](http://amzn.to/2kHB4kc) and it's incredible (and very expensive ðŸ˜‘).
* I listen to Bose QC35 headphones all day at my desk and AirPods Pro when on the go
